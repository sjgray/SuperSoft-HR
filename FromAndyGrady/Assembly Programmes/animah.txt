For 64k addon board ONLY

Programme to compress an image displayed using the supersoft board and store in PET RAM. It uses an image counter and table for the low and high
address where the image should be stored. Any programme should start by setting these to set the first image.

The playback animation code will cycle through the image stack and display each image on after the other to simulate animation.

Use TIM to load anaimahmod.prg

Protect from basic programmes

Poke 52,0: Poke 53,18:CLR

Load basic programme. before cfreatign an animation, set image number and starting low and high image address pointer for the code to store the first image.
The code will tehn increment the no images by 1 and when called again store the next image after the previous one etc.

Image Number : $7f00 (poke 32512,0)

Image pointer table

Image Low Ad : $7f01 (poke 32513,0) suggest starting address : $00
Image High Ad: $7f31 (poke 32576,32)suggest starting address : $80

To compress an image and save to PET 64k addon memory : SYS 30208

It starts with banks 02 and whe filed switches to banks 13

When finished constructing image stack, ensure total number of images is decreased by 1

To run the animation SYS 30490
This will pull the image number, and use it to get the image low and high address in memory from the pointer table and display on the SS board.
Enable the board before running.

Pressing the STOP key will break out of the animation and it has performed a complete cycle.

SYS 30775 runs the 64l addon Add-Mon board so you can save images and load then into the memory bank.

*80 sets banks 02 

Syntax identical to TIM for loading and saving

*8C sets banks 13


To save your work just use the Add-Mon programme, SYS 30775, to save the pointer table and your compressed images to disk
