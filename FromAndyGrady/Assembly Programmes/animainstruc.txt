Programme to compress an image displayed using the supersoft board and store in PET RAM. It uses an image counter and table for the low and high
address where the image should be stored. Any programme should start by setting these to set th foirst image.

The playback animation code will cycle through the image stack and display each image on after the other to simulate animation.

Use TIM to load anaima.prg

Protect from basic programmes

Poke 52,16: Poke 53,126:CLR

Load basic programme. before cfreatign an animation, set image number and starting low and high image address pointer for the code to store the first image.
The code will tehn increment the no images by 1 and when called again store the next image after the previous one etc.

Image Number : $1f00 (poke 7936,0)

Image pointer table

Image Low Ad : $1f01 (poke 7937,0) suggest starting address : $00
Image High Ad: $1f31 (poke 7985,32)suggest starting address : $20

To compress an image and save to PET memory : SYS 32272
There is no checking if the imaged when stored in RAM will overwrite this programme.

When finished constructing image stack, ensure total number of images is decreased by 1

To run the animation SYS 32523
This will pull the image number, and use it to get the image low and high address in memory from the pointer table and display on the SS board.
Enable the board before running.
Pressing the STOP key will break out of the animation and it has performed a complete cycle.

To save your work just use TIM to save the pointer table and your compressed images to disk
