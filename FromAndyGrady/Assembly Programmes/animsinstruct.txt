Programme to compress an image displayed using the supersoft board and store in PET RAM. It uses an image counter and table for the low and high
address where the image should be stored. Any programme should start by setting these to the starting location as shown below.

Use this for displaying single compressed images.

Use TIM to load anaims.prg

Protect from basic programmes

Poke 52,25: Poke 53,126:CLR

Load basic programme. before cfreatign an animation, set image number and starting low and high image address pointer for the code to store the first image.
The code will tehn increment the no images by 1 and when called again store the next image after the previous one etc.

Image Number : $1f00 (poke 7936,0)

Image pointer table

Image Low Ad : $1f01 (poke 7937,0) suggest starting address : $00
Image High Ad: $1f31 (poke 7985,32)suggest starting address : $20

To compress an image and save to PET memory : SYS 32288
There is no checking if the imaged when stored in RAM will overwrite this programme.

When finished constructing image stack, ensure total number of images is decreased by 1

To display a compressed image set the image number and then call SYS 32539

This will pull the image number, and use it to get the image low and high address in memory from the pointer table and display on the SS board.
Enable the board before running. After displaying hte image it will return to basic


To save your work just use TIM to save the pointer table and your compressed images to disk
