These programmes assumes the person knows how to write basic programme and has familiarity with machine code and using the TIM.

The User manual for the SuperSoft HR-40 graphics card is on Mike's website.

The PolyGon programs were created by adapting the code in the book "ADVANCED GRAPHICS WITH THE BBC MICRO" and also "Advanced Graphics with the Sinclair ZX Spectrum"
written by Ian O. Angell and Brian J. Jones. These are great texts for learning anbout matrix calcualtions, rotations and plotting the results.
I have had to adapt the code to run on the PET with the SS board.

The subroutines in the basic PET polygon drawing programmes are as follows (use the above book for how these are used)

fnangle : 8800
rot3	: 8600
scale3	: 8900
mult3	: 9000
idr3	: 9200
trans3	: 9300
set orig : 9600
scale	: 9700
moveto	: 9760
lineto	: 9770
triangle :10000
