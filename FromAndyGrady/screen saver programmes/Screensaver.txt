The SCN programmes are bsaic/assembly programmes that cycle through a number of saved compressed images to simulate a screen saver.

First initialise the SS board and clear the memory.

Run TIM and load "anims.prg" into memory.

Then from the basic prompt, 

poke 52,16:poke 53,126:clr

This protects the animation/compression program form basic programmes.

load the SCN... basic programes and run.

For reference, the image number is found in 7936 ($1f00). The low byte for the compressed image is 7937 ($1f01) and the high byte 7985 ($1f31)
 in the image table.

To compress an image you much first setup the starting pointers by zeroing the image number and defineing the low high bytes for where the compressed 
imaged will be stored in PET memory.

SYS 32272 compresses the image and increases the image count by 1. The next time this is called the compression code picks this numebr and tags the next
compressed image to the end of the last one

SYS 32523 displayes the compressed image defined by the image number in the SS memory.
